         <h4>Goals</h4>
         <p>In the short term I hope to learn code and transition from a career in Science to one in the Tech industry. Ideally I'd love to work somewhere that I can use both skills of knowing how to code and my knowledge of chemistry and genetics I gained during my degree. I am determined to build up a portfolio of work and improve my coding skills through the Code fellows school.</p>
